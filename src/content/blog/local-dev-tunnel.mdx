**TL;DR:** Want to see your Astro site on your phone before deploying? Use VS Code Ports for secure, private testing, or Astro Tunnel for instant, public sharingâ€”no logins, no hassle.

Devtools are great, but testing your Astro site on a real phone is the only way to make sure it's ready for prime time. Here are two super-fast ways to get your local dev server onto your phone.

## 1. VS Code Ports: Secure, Flexible, Built-In

[VS Codeâ€™s Ports](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/port-forwarding) feature lets you share your local server with a public URL. Great for private testing or team reviews.

1. **Start your dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This usually starts your site at `http://localhost:4321`.

2. **Open the Ports tab** in VS Code (bottom panel or via Command Palette).
3. **Forward your port** (usually 4321), sign in if prompted, and grab your public URL.
4. **Test on your phone:** Open the link or scan the QR code in VS Code.

**Pro tip:** Tunnels are private by default. If you make your tunnel public for client review, anyone with the link can access itâ€”no login requiredâ€”but theyâ€™ll see a security warning page (from the tunnel provider) and must click through. Not the smoothest for non-technical users.

## 2. Astro Tunnel: Instant, Public, No Logins

[Astro Tunnel](https://github.com/morinokami/astro-tunnel) uses Cloudflare to give you a public link in seconds. Perfect for client demos or quick mobile checks.

1. **Add Astro Tunnel:**

   ```bash
   npx astro add astro-tunnel
   ```

2. **Run your dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Click the Tunnel icon** in the Astro Dev Toolbar to get your public URL.
4. **Open on your phone:** Paste the link in your browserâ€”done!

  Both methods expose your local site to the internet if made public. For
  sensitive projects, use VS Code and keep the port private.

## Verdict

- **VS Code Ports:** Best for private, secure testing. QR codes make phone access easy.
- **Astro Tunnel:** Fastest way to share with anyone, anywhere. Seamless Astro integration.

Try both and see which fits your workflowâ€”either way, youâ€™ll be previewing your Astro site on your phone in minutes. ðŸš€
