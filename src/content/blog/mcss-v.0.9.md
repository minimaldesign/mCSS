## Hello World!

After a couple months of hard work, mCSS is out! I’m releasing it as v.0.9 to make sure I can incorporate all the feedback I get from the community before the official 1.0 launch.

I only have a couple of [components][1] built out, but you don't need components to start using the framework to build websites and/or your _own_ component.

The next step I'm working on is finalizing the theming system.

Then I'll build out a few website templates with mCSS, creating components as needed. So I'll have a lot more components added regularly in the near future. And if you'd like to contribute components, feel free to [open a PR][2] and I'll review it with you to make sure it follows the current (undocumented for now…) coding standards.
