Here is the updated CSS animation properties cheat sheet with "Description" and "Possible values" bolded:

| Property                    | Description and Possible Values                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `animation-name`            | Specifies the name of the `@keyframes` animation.<br/>Custom name, e.g. `slideIn`, `fadeOut`                                         |
| `animation-duration`        | Defines how long the animation takes to complete.<br/>Time values, e.g. `2s`, `500ms`                                                |
| `animation-timing-function` | Controls the speed curve of the animation over time.<br/>`linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, `cubic-bezier(...)` |
| `animation-delay`           | Delay before the animation starts.<br/>Time values, e.g. `1s`, `200ms`                                                               |
| `animation-iteration-count` | Number of times the animation repeats.<br/>Number or `infinite`                                                                      |
| `animation-direction`       | Direction in which the animation plays.<br/>`normal`, `reverse`, `alternate`, `alternate-reverse`                                    |
| `animation-fill-mode`       | [Defines style applied](/blog/css-animation-fill-modes) before/after animation.<br/>`none`, `forwards`, `backwards`, `both`          |
| `animation-play-state`      | Controls whether the animation is running or paused.<br/>`running`, `paused`                                                         |

## Shorthand & Properties Order

In the shorthand `animation` property, only `animation-name` and `animation-duration` are mandatory. All others are optional.

The only properties that require a specific order are `animation-duration`, which has to be before `animation-delay` (optional) since they're both durations. All other values are unique and can be parsed independently of their order.

It is recommended however to follow this conventional order, to improve readability and maintainability:

1. `animation-name`
1. `animation-duration`
1. `animation-timing-function`
1. `animation-delay`
1. `animation-iteration-count`
1. `animation-direction`
1. `animation-fill-mode`
1. `animation-play-state`

### Example of Common Usage:

```css
animation: fadeOut 3s ease-in 1s infinite alternate forwards;
```

- `fadeOut`: animation-name
- `3s`: duration
- `ease-in`: timing function
- `1s`: delay
- `infinite`: iteration count
- `alternate`: direction
- `forwards`: fill mode
