## New take on the classic

The best way to center an element without modifying its container or affecting its siblings.

```css
.block {
  max-width: fit-content;
  margin-inline: auto;
}
```

## Flexbox

The most ubiquitous technic that should be the go-to in most cases.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

## Grid

Similar to the `flexbox` solution, but note `align-content` vs `align-items`. **I recommend sticking with flexbox**, as the grid layout algorithm is more complex and tends to make it more finicky to work with in some cases.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  align-content: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

## For positioned elements

Great for `absolute` or `fixed` positioned elements. The browser resolves the conflicting `inset` and dimensions (`width`/`height` in this example) declarations by centering the element.

```css
.box {
  position: absolute;
  height: fit-content;
  width: fit-content;
  inset: 0;
  margin: auto;
}
```
