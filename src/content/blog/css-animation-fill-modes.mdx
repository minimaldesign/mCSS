## Why CSS properties "snap back"

A common problem when using CSS `@keyframes` animations is that property values temporarily change during the animation but revert to their original state once the animation ends.

In this example, the div "snaps back" to `opacity: 1;` when the animation ends:

<div
  class="codepen"
  data-height="400"
  data-default-tab="html,result"
  data-slug-hash="KwVWVeJ"
  data-pen-title="CSS animation Fill Modes 01"
  data-user="_yann"
  style="height: 400px;"
></div>

### Why Does This Happen?

During an animation, the browser applies intermediate styles defined in `@keyframes`. However, after the animation completes, by default, the affected properties return to their original values as defined outside the animation.

### An easy fix

The `animation-fill-mode` property controls how styles are applied before and after a keyframe animation runs:

- `none` (default): No styles from the animation persist after it ends.
- `forwards`: The element retains the styles from the last keyframe after completion.
- `backwards`: Styles from the first keyframe is applied during any animation delay.
- `both`: Applies both `forwards` and `backwards` effects.

It's most common to use the shorthand syntax for this property.

In thisd example we use `backwards` to set `.test` to `opacity: 0;` during the `1s` delay:

<div
  class="codepen"
  data-height="400"
  data-default-tab="html,result"
  data-slug-hash="bNEqpGO"
  data-pen-title="CSS animation Fill Modes 01"
  data-user="_yann"
  style="height: 400px; border: 0;"

</div>
