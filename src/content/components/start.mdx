## Framework agnostic UI component library

<Notice type="warning" title="Work in progress" extraClass="mt-md1 mb-md1">
  The component library is being actively worked on. The `button` and `.notice`
  components included here are meant to be used as examples on how to build your
  own.
</Notice>

The mCSS component library is entirely built with the [mCSS framework](/docs/start). As long as you include **mCSS** in your project, all you have to do is copy + paste the HTML/CSS in your project, regardless of what framework you're using, and it will work out of the box.

An [Astro](https://astro.build) version of the component library is being worked on in parallel. If you'd like to be notified when it's ready (and/or beta test it), you can [sign up for my mailing list here]().
