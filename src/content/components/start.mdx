## Framework agnostic UI component library

The mCSS component library is entirely built with the mCSS framework. As long as you include mCSS in your project, all you have to do is copy + paste the HTML/CSS on each components page and it will work out of the box.

There are 2 types of components:

- **Global components:** styles that can be used throughout your UI, like [buttons](/components/button).
- **Components:** self contained HTML/CSS pair, like a product card.

I'm working on an Astro component library version that will use the same HTML/CSS. If you'd like to be notified when it's ready (and/or beta test it), you can [sign up to my mailing list here]().
