## Recommended responsive setup

If you search online for the best appraoch when it comes to responsive design and setting up your breakpoints, you'll most likely comer accross the technically true but useless "it depends" answer.

Unless you have a good reason not to, you should use a mobile first approach. What that means is you design will work great on small screen out of the box, without any media queries, and then you add your tweaks for additional sizes.

In short, most component should look something like this:

```html

```
