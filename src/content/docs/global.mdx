## Grid

<section class="docs_section prose">

| File name         | Source            |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `global.grid.css` | [Github][srcGrid] |

[srcGrid]: https://github.com/minimaldesign/mCSS/blob/main/src/styles/global.grid.css

The grid system is extremely easy to use, light weight, and very flexible. It uses the [CSS grid property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) under the hood, but it lets you set up your layouts directly into your HTML. The implementation is heavily inspired by [Raster](https://github.com/rsms/raster).

### Syntax

It's composed of 2 classes: `.grid` for the container, and `.grid_item` for each grid item.

You define the amount of columns of your grid with a custom `col` attribute and the position/width of your grid_items with the custom `span` attribute.

The `span` property syntax follows these 5 patterns:

- `row`: the grid_item spans a full row
- `3`: the grid_item start in the next column and spans 3 columns.
- `3-5`: the grid_item starts in column 3 and ends in column 5.
- `3+5`: the grid_item starts in column 3 and spans for 5 columns.
- `3..`: the grid_item starts in column 3 and spans the remainder of rows.

Both the `col` and `span` attributes have responsive versions, which use [the "mobile first" approach][1] of the `--*-n-above` media queries.

<Notice type="info" title="HTML Validation">
  The custom attribute will not validate. If this is important to you, you'll
  need to change the attributes to `data-col` and `data-span` in both the CSS
  and HTML. I personally prefer to use shorter, more legible attributes. Check
  this thread on Github if you'd like to read more than you've ever wanted to
  know about [custom attributes and
  validation](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2271).

### Examples

#### Different types of spans

9 colum grid, with all types of spans.

<div class="grid docs_grid" col="9">
  <div class="grid_item" span="2">
    2
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="4-5">
    4-5
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="6..">
    6..
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="3-3">
    3-3
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="5..">
    5..
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="2+3">
    2+3
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="6+2">
    6+2
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="row">
    row
  </div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="4+2">
    4+2
  </div>
</div>

```html
<div class="grid" col="9">
  <div class="grid_item" span="2">2</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="4-5">4-5</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="6..">6..</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="3-3">3-3</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="5..">5..</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="2+3">2+3</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="6+2">6+2</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="row">row</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="4+2">4+2</div>
</div>
```

#### Responsive grid

<section class="docs_section prose">
The grid layout follows a "mobile first" approach using `--*-n-above` media queries.

The following example goes from 1 → 4 → 9 → 12 columns. (Resize window to see it in action.)

<div class="grid docs_grid" col="1" col-md="4" col-lg="9" col-xl="12">
  <div class="grid_item">1</div>
  <div class="grid_item">2</div>
  <div class="grid_item">3</div>
  <div class="grid_item">4</div>
  <div class="grid_item">5</div>
  <div class="grid_item">6</div>
  <div class="grid_item">7</div>
  <div class="grid_item">8</div>
  <div class="grid_item">9</div>
  <div class="grid_item">10</div>
  <div class="grid_item">11</div>
  <div class="grid_item">12</div>
</div>

```html
<div class="grid" col="1" col-md="4" col-lg="9" col-xl="12">[…]</div>
```

<section class="docs_section prose">

| File name         | Source            |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `global.wrap.css` | [Github][srcWrap] |

[srcWrap]: https://github.com/minimaldesign/mCSS/blob/main/src/styles/global.wrap.css

The `.wrap` global class is a simple content wrapper that will center your content on the page and add some left/right padding on small viewports.

### Syntax

```html
<div class="wrap">
  <section class="wrap_content">
    <!-- content -->
  </section>
</div>
```

### Settings

You can customize 3 diffent sizes of left/right padding for responsive designs as well as the width of your content. The values below are set in the default theme.

| token             | value                  | Description                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `wrap-padding`    | `var(--sm1)`           | default left/right padding       |
| `wrap-md-padding` | `var(--sm3)`           | left/right padding tablet and up |
| `wrap-lg-padding` | `0`                    | left/right padding laptop and up |
| `wrap-width`      | `minmax(300px, 800px)` | 300px minimum, 800px maximum     |

## Layouts

<section class="docs_section prose">

| File name           | Source              |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| `global.layout.css` | [Github][srcLayout] |

[srcLayout]: https://github.com/minimaldesign/mCSS/blob/main/src/styles/global.layout.css

This is where your global layouts should go. It's probably too project specific for mCSS to ship with really useful default layouts. But this will change as more [components](/components/start) become available.

<Notice type="warning" title="Work in progress">
  The layouts in this file are specific to mcss.dev docs and blog sections.
  They're not built as templates to use in your own projects but rather as
  examples of how to set it up.

## Prose

<section class="docs_section prose">

| File name          | Source             |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `global.prose.css` | [Github][srcProse] |

[srcProse]: https://github.com/minimaldesign/mCSS/blob/main/src/styles/global.prose.css

This global `.prose` can be used anywhere you need basic typography for long form text, like articles, blog posts, etc.

It make spacing between paragraphs, lists, tables, etc. consistant. It also adds extra styling for `ol`, `ul`, and `code` elements.
