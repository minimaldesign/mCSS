The mCSS reset is kept to a minimum. It does the following:

- It sets the `box-sizing` to `border-box`
- It removes the default `margin` on all elements
- It sets the document's `min-height` to 100%.

The rest of the defaults that would traditionally be included in a "reset" or "normalize" file are handled by the `elements.*.css` files.

Refer to the [mCSS File structure][structure] section of _Getting Started_ for more details. You can find an example of all HTML elements default styling in the [next section](/docs/elements).
