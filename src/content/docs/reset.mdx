The mCSS reset is very minimal. It basically just sets the `box-sizing` to `border-box` and removes the default `margin` on all elements, and sets the document's `min-height` to 100%.

The rest of the defaults that would traditionally be considered a "reset" or "normalise" are handled by the `elements.*.css` files. You can find the documentation for those in the [next section](/docs/elements).
