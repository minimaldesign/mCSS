  This feature is still in beta and the implementation details are likely to
  change while the mCSS components are built out. However, if you use the mCSS
  framework to build your own components, it is recommended to use a theme as a
  token abstraction layer. See the _Getting Started_ section for more info.

Themes offer an additional layer of abstraction for [tokens](/docs/tokens). Theme tokens only ever take another token for value and are useful to standardize UI elements in logical groups. For example, you can have a `--light-border-color` with a value of `--base-100`. This allows you to create tokens with meaning and context which makes them more intuitive to use.
