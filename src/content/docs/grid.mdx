The grid system is extremely easy to use, light weight, and very flexible. It uses the [CSS grid property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) under the hood, but it lets you set up your layouts directly into your HTML. The implementation is heavily inspired by [Raster](https://github.com/rsms/raster).

## Syntax

It's composed of 2 classes: `.grid` for the container, and `.grid_item` for each grid item.

You define the amount of columns of your grid with a custom `col` attribute and the position/width of your grid_items with the custom `span` attribute.

The `span` property syntax follows these 5 patterns:

- `row`: the grid_item spans a full row
- `3`: the grid_item start in the next column and spans 3 columns.
- `3-5`: the grid_item starts in column 3 and ends in column 5.
- `3+5`: the grid_item starts in column 3 and spans for 5 columns.
- `3..`: the grid_item starts in column 3 and spans the remainder of rows.

Both the `col` and `span` attributes have responsive versions, which use the "mobile first" appraoch of the `--*-n-above` media queries.

**Note:** the custom attribute will not validate. If this is important to you, you'll need to change the attributes to `data-col` and `data-span` in both the CSS and HTML. I personally prefer to use shorter, more legible attributes. Check this thread on Github if you'd like to read more than you've ever wanted to know about [custom attributes and validation](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2271).

## Examples

### Different types of spans

9 colum grid, with all types of spans.

<div class="grid docs_grid" col="9">
  <div class="grid_item" span="2">`2`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="4-5">`4-5`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="6..">`6..`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="3-3">`3-3`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="5..">`5..`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="2+3">`2+3`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="6+2">`6+2`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="row">`row`</div>
  <div class="grid_item" span="4+2">`4+2`</div>
</div>

### Responsive grid

The grid layout follows a "mobile first" approach using `--*-n-above` media queries.

The following example goes from  1 → 4 → 9 → 12 columns.

```html
<div class="grid" col="1" col-md="4" col-lg="9" col-xl="12">
  […]
</div>
```

<div class="grid docs_grid" col="1" col-md="4" col-lg="9" col-xl="12">
  <div class="grid_item">1</div>
  <div class="grid_item">2</div>
  <div class="grid_item">3</div>
  <div class="grid_item">4</div>
  <div class="grid_item">5</div>
  <div class="grid_item">6</div>
  <div class="grid_item">7</div>
  <div class="grid_item">8</div>
  <div class="grid_item">9</div>
  <div class="grid_item">10</div>
  <div class="grid_item">11</div>
  <div class="grid_item">12</div>
</div>
